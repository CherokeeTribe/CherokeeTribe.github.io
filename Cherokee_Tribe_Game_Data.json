        "The Origin of Fire": "Long ago, the animals of the earth lived in a time of darkness, as fire was unknown to them.\n\nOne day, they saw a flicker of light on an island far across the water. It was the first fire, guarded jealously by the Thunders, powerful beings who lived there.\n\nThe animals gathered to discuss how they could bring the fire to their own land. After much deliberation, it was decided that the only way to acquire it was to send the swiftest among them to retrieve it.\n\nFirst, the Raven volunteered. With his dark wings, he flew across the water to the island. He waited until the Thunders weren't looking, then he swooped down to grab a piece of the fire. But as he grasped it in his beak, the flames singed his feathers, turning them black. He dropped the fire and returned to the animals with nothing but his burnt feathers as proof of his attempt.\n\nNext, the Screech Owl tried his luck. He flew silently over the water and approached the fire. But when he tried to pick it up, the sparks flew into his eyes, giving him his fiery red eyes that all screech owls have today. He, too, returned without the fire.\n\nThe animals were losing hope when the lowly Water Spider stepped forward. The other animals scoffed at her, but she assured them she could do it. She spun a small web and made it into a tiny bowl that she could carry on her back. Then she scurried across the water to the island. The Thunders did not notice the little Water Spider as she approached the fire.\n\nShe carefully took a single ember and placed it in her web bowl. She then hurried back across the water to the animals on the mainland.\n\nThe animals rejoiced when they saw the little ember in the Water Spider’s bowl. They used it to create fire, which they have kept ever since.\n\nFrom that day on, the Water Spider was revered for her cleverness and bravery, and the fire has brought warmth and light to the Cherokee people.",
        "The Eagles Revenge": "Once a hunter in the mountains heard a noise at night like a rushing wind.\n\nHe went outside his tepee, and found an eagle was sitting on the drying pole, feasting at the deer he had shot. So, he shot the eagle. The next morning the hunter took the deer back to the village. He told how he had shot the deer and then the eagle. Therefore the chief sent out men to bring in the eagle, and have an Eagle dance.\n\nThat night when they were dancing, there was a whoop outside. A strange warrior walked into the circle. He was not of that village. They thought he had come from one of the other Cherokee villages. This warrior told how he had killed a man. At the end of the story, he yelled, 'Hi!' One of the men with rattles, who was leading the dance, fell dead.\n\nThe stranger sang of another deed. At the end he yelled, 'Hi!' Another rattler fell dead. The people were frightened. But the stranger sang of another great deed. Then again, he yelled, 'Hi!' Again, a man with the rattles fell dead. So, all seven men who had rattles and who were leading the dance fell dead. And the people were too frightened to leave the lodge where they were dancing.\n\nThen the stranger vanished into the darkness. Long after, they learned that the stranger was the brother of the eagle that had been killed.",
        "Strangers": "Up on a ridge, a rough eminence about a dozen miles from Tennessee, was once an abiding place of Cherokee, among whom lived Arinook, their medicine-man, and his daughter.\n\nThe girl was pure and fair, and when a passing hunter from another tribe saw her one day at the door of her father’s home he was so struck with her charm of person and her engaging manner that he resolved not to return to his people until he had won her for his wife. She had many lovers, though she favored none of them, and while the Cherokees were at first loth to admit a stranger to their homes, they forgot their jealousy when they found that this one excelled as a hunter and fisherman, that he could throw the knife and tomahawk better than themselves, and that he was apt in their work and their sports.\n\nThey even submitted to the inevitable with half a grace when they found that the stranger and the girl of whom they were so fond were in love. With an obduracy that seems to be characteristic of fathers, the medicine-man refused his consent to the union, and the hearts of the twain were heavy. Though the hunter pleaded with her to desert her tribe, she refused to do so, on the score of duty to her father, and the couple forlornly roamed about the hill, watching the sunset from its top and passing the bright summer evenings alone, sitting hand in hand, loving, sorrowing, and speaking not.\n\nIn one of their long rambles, they found themselves beside the Tennessee River at a point where the current swirls among rocks and sucks down things that float, discharging them at the surface in still water, down the stream. Here for a time, they stood, when the girl, with a gush of tears, began to sing—it was her death-song. The hunter grasped her hand and joined his voice to hers. Then they took a last embrace and flung themselves into the water, still hand in hand. When the river is low you may hear their death-song sounding there.\n\nThe spirits of the river and the wood were offended with the medicine-man because of his stubbornness and cruelty, although he suffered greatly because of the death his daughter died, and he the cause of it. Following the tragedy, more strangers appeared among the Cherokees. Tall, strong, and large were these intruders, and they hung about the village by day and night—never speaking, yet casting a fear about them, for they would throw great rocks farther than a warrior could shoot an arrow with the wind behind him. They had horns springing from their heads; their eyes were the eyes of wild-cats, and shone in the dark; they growled like animals, shaking the earth when they did so, and breathing flame. They drove the deer and bear away. They were at the bedside, at the council-fire, at the banquet, seeming only to wait for a show of enmity to annihilate the tribe.\n\nAt length the people could endure their company no longer, and taking down their lodges they left the area and wandered far away until they came to a valley where no foot had left its impress. There, they besought the Great Spirit to forgive the wrong their medicine-man had done, and to free them from the terrible spirits that had been living among them. The prayer was granted, and the lodges stood for many years in a safe and happy valley."
